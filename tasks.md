# Project Tasks

1. Design and implement multiple autonomous agents for data analysis:
   - IngestionAgent: Collects data from various sources.
   - QueryAgent: Retrieves and filters data using BigQuery.
   - InsightAgent: Analyzes data to derive meaningful insights.
   - PresentationAgent: Presents findings collaboratively.

2. Integrate Google Cloud services:
   - Use BigQuery for data storage and querying.
   - Optionally use Pub/Sub for agent communication.

3. Ensure agents operate autonomously and in sequence:
   - Automate the workflow from ingestion to presentation.
   - Enable agents to trigger each other or use shared storage.

4. Implement robust data ingestion from multiple sources:
   - Support different data formats and endpoints.

5. Develop advanced data analysis logic:
   - Extract trends, patterns, and actionable insights.
   - Make analysis extensible for future needs.

6. Build collaborative presentation mechanisms:
   - Output insights via logs, reports, dashboards, or notifications.
   - Ensure findings are clear and actionable.

7. Provide configuration and deployment scripts:
   - Centralize configuration for all agents.
   - Include scripts for setup, deployment, and running agents.

8. Document the system:
   - Provide architecture diagrams and workflow descriptions.
   - Write clear instructions for building, running, and extending the system.
